#### To run a game, input one of the following commands, depending on the game you want to play:

| **Command**	| **Game description** | **Expected answer** |
|:-------------:|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|
| brain-calc	| *performing arithmetic operations of addition / substraction / multiplication* | integer |
| brain-even    | *determining whether a number is even (division by two gives an integer) or not* | "yes"/"no" in words |
| brain-gcd 	| *finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers* | integer |
| brain-prime	| *determining whether a number is prime (only division by 1 and the number itsels gives an integer) or not* | "yes"/"no" in words |
| brain-progression | *finding the missing term of a progression (common difference always equals 2)* | integer |

To win a game, you must answer three questions.

#### Here are some videos illustrating how to install the package and run the games:
