# My fisrt frontend project (lvl 1)

Hello, stranger!
This is my first project ever. It's a pack of little math games I encourage you to play!

## Installation

To install the app, input the following command:

	npm link

To run a game, input one of the following commands, depending on the game you want to play:

| **Command**	| **Game description** | **Expected answer** |
|:-------------:|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|
| brain-calc	| *doing arithmetic operations of addition / substraction / multiplication* | integer |
| brain-even    | *determining whether the given number is even (division by two gives an integer)* | "yes"/"no" in words |
| brain-gcd 	| *finding the greatest common divisor of the two given numbers* | integer |
| brain-prime	| *determining whether given number is prime (only division by 1 and the number itsels gives an integer)* | "yes"/"no" in words |
| brain-progression | *finding the missing term of the given progression (common difference always equals 2)* | integer |

Each game has three rounds; there is one question for each round. If you answer all three questions correctly you win! c:
